### Overview
A command-line application that retrieves and displays film data from a mysql database. This allows the user to search for films by ID, or to search by a keyword from the title or description. Through the use of multiple table joins, it also delivers a copy of all film details and extras (language, genre, actors, etc.).

### How to run
